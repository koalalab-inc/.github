KoalaLab is building solutions to protect the most overlooked aspect of sofware supply chain: CI/CD pipelines.
Modern build systems have become complex and with the rise in software supply chain attacks, they remain open to cyberattacks.
KoalaLab aims to bring the security rigor and paradigms of production systems to build systems namely:

- Security Posture Management(SCM)
- Egress filtering to harden CI envrionment
- Observability of CI/CD systems
